### Tan Malaka once said
> "If young people who have studied in school and consider themselves too high and smart to merge with society who work with hoes and only have simple aspirations, 
it is better that education is not given at all." - Tan Malaka.

### This site was built using [Praxis Academy](https://github.com/praxis-academy/).
Praxis Academy is a place to practice web developer programming. This time I focused on the front end, which is programming that aims to design the interface of the website and make it easy for users to use the website. The programming languages used on the front end include [HTML](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [JavaScript](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), and [CSS](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets). While the framework used is [React](https://reactjs.org/) from [Facebook](Facebook).
